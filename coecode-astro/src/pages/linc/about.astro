        <div class="space-y-6 text-white/80 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            In our hyperconnected world, it's paradoxically easy to lose touch with the people who matter most. 
            I found myself constantly wondering, "When was the last time I talked to my college roommate?" or 
            "I should really call my grandmother more often."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Linc was born from this personal frustration. As someone who values deep relationships but struggles 
            with the mental overhead of maintaining them all, I needed a simple, beautiful way to track my 
            interactions and get gentle reminders to reach out.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The app isn't about turning friendships into a checklist—it's about giving you the awareness and 
            gentle nudges you need to nurture the relationships that truly matter to you. Every feature in Linc 
            was designed with privacy, simplicity, and genuine human connection in mind.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I hope Linc helps you stay closer to the people you care about, just as it has helped me.
